# PrestaShop docs csv_import
This is a .csv file example for PrestaShop where all the columns names and order of the column match the last Prestashop varsion importer columns and order making it much more simple to understand how you can upload your products and product combinations.  It saved me tons of nerves while configurating my own shop www.skleia.com

Tested with PrestaShop version 1.7.8.4

## How it works
The column names and order on the left in Excell file will be the same as default order of the PrestaShop importer on the right.
